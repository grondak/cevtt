# cevtt

cevtt is a browser-based implementation of [The Cepheus Engine](https://www.orffenspace.com/cepheus-srd/introduction.html) ruleset's [space combat system](https://www.orffenspace.com/cepheus-srd/space-combat.html)

## Principles & Features
Multi-player, multi-game

* Users own characters and ships
* Users create or join games
* Users bring their characters or ships to games
* A character or ship can be in more than one game (they start fresh)
* The playing field for a game is scalable and zoomable to a given point
* Ships' sensors may see less information than the server knows about another ship,
* and that information is hidden from the client so a crafty user cannot cheat
* Future: The game adds vector movement to the Cepheus Engine combat systam -- and understands vector physics
* The game has an advance-able clock (1000 seconds by the engine)
